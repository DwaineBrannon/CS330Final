How do I approach designing software?
  When designing software, I will look at the software requirements
  and make a plan based off of the requirements i'm given.
 How do I approach Developing programs
  I approach development similar to designing. I collect requirements 
  and create a plan based off those requirements. For my 3D scene,
  I had to follow a ton of tutorials on the internet for creating
  objects in opengl because it was a hard project! 
 How do computational graphics and visualizatioins give you the knowledgea nd skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  These can help in the future because I have wanted to get into video game development and I think that having a baseline understanding on writing to the GPU of your machine is super important in that.
